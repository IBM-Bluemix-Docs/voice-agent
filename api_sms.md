# API for Managing SMS Sessions
{: #api-sms}

You can perform REST API operations to create and delete SMS sessions and trigger Watson Assistant to send outbound SMS requests.

To initiate a SMS operation, make an HTTP POST request to the SMS service endpoint. The service endpoint for your service instance can be found in the Getting Started page of your {{site.data.keyword.iva_full}} dashboard.

For instance:

`US South: https://sms-south.voiceagent.cloud.ibm.com`

`US East: https://sms-east.voiceagent.cloud.ibm.com`

`Frankfurt: https://sms-fra04.voiceagent.cloud.ibm.com or https://sms-fra05.voiceagent.cloud.ibm.com`

## More information

For the API documentation on SMS, see [IBM Voice Agent API Documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/voice-agent/sms-api).
